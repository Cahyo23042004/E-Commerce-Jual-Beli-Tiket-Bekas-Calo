Application Flow
User Interaction: Users interact with the application through the frontend, navigating different pages and interacting with UI components.

Routing: React Router (or a similar library) manages the routing, directing users to different pages like home, tickets listing, and ticket details.

API Calls: The frontend makes API calls to the backend for operations like fetching ticket listings, user authentication, and purchasing tickets. These API services are defined in the services/ directory.

State Management: React's state management techniques (e.g., useState, useReducer) are used to manage the state of the application, ensuring that the UI updates dynamically based on user interactions and API responses.

Rendering: Components dynamically render the UI based on the current state and data received from the API.

Example Components and Pages
components/Header.js: The header component for navigation and branding.
components/Footer.js: The footer component.
pages/Home.js: The homepage, showcasing featured tickets and promotions.
pages/Tickets.js: A page displaying a list of available tickets for sale.
services/api.js: Contains functions to handle API requests, such as fetching tickets and user authentication.
